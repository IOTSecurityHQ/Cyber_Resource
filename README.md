### Trusted Execution Environment

A TEE runs alongside the Rich Execution Environment (e.g., Linux) to perform security-critical functions.

### Network Security

This is mostly dealing with firwwall which restrict network traffic based on 
the IP address. There are few vendors. The best way to learn is understand how to setup CISCO, Fortigate devices.  

-**Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy**
[Firwewall Policy](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-41r1.pdf)

The industry is moving into zero trust principle which mean all network interaction must be authenticated and authorized. 
this is nist paper on zero trust.
